# Sea Level Predictor

This project is part of the **Data Analysis with Python** certification from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). This project analyzes historical sea level data and predicts future trends using linear regression. It visualizes the results in a scatter plot with two lines of best fit: one based on all available data, and another based only on more recent data (from the year 2000 onward).

## Visualizations

## Files

- `epa-sea-level.csv` — The dataset containing historical sea level measurements.
- `sea_level_predictor.py` — The Python script that reads the data, creates the plot, and saves it as `sea_level_plot.png`.
- `sea_level_plot.png` — The output plot generated by the script.

## How It Works

1. **Data Reading:**  
   The script reads the sea level data from `epa-sea-level.csv` using `pandas`.

2. **Scatter Plot:**  
   A scatter plot of the original data is created to visualize historical sea level measurements.

3. **First Line of Best Fit (1880–2050):**  
   - A linear regression line is fitted using all available data from 1880.
   - This line is extended to predict sea levels up to the year 2050.

4. **Second Line of Best Fit (2000–2050):**  
   - A second regression line is fitted using data from the year 2000 onward.
   - This line also extends predictions up to 2050 to show recent trends separately.

5. **Plot Annotations:**  
   - The plot includes a title, x-axis (Year) and y-axis (Sea Level in inches) labels.
   - A legend distinguishes the two lines of best fit.

6. **Saving Output:**  
   - The final plot is saved as `sea_level_plot.png`.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
